This repo contains useful plugins I made for IntelliJ Idea via LivePlugin extension.


## Vault links highlighter

If you are using some sort of HashiCorp Vault intergration, you may often need to directly open Vault's paths in WebUI. This plugin highlights vault usage (by given regexp) in any yaml files, and adds action to context menu to open them. You only need to specify address to your vault web ui.
